abstract = {The investigations described in this series are concerned with the conditions of independence and lack of independence in the face of group pressure. The abstract temper of present-day theory and investigation in this region rests to a considerable degree on a neglect of the cognitive and emotional experiences that are part of the individual's psychological field. The understanding of social influences will require the study of a wide range of conditions and of the interrelated operations of different psychological functions. A group of seven to nine individuals was gathered in a classroom to take part in what appeared to be a simple experiment in visual discrimination. The subjects were all male, white college students, ranging in age from 17 to 25; the mean age was 20. For certain purposes a large number of critical subjects was required for the present experiment. The present report is based on a total of 123 subjects. The task consisted of the comparison of a standard line with th},

In this paper, I discuss the development of mentalizing and communication from the perspectives of a new idea, Developmental Cybernetics, and developmental cognitive neuroscience. Children only attributed intention to a robot when they saw it behaving as a human and displaying social signals such as eye gaze. The emergence of powerful new methods and tools, such as neuroimaging, now allows questions about mentalizing to resolved more directly than before.},

abstract = {The mentalizing (theory of mind) system of the brain is probably in operation from ca. 18 months of age, allowing implicit attribution of intentions and other mental states. Between the ages of 4 and 6 years explicit mentalizing becomes possible, and from this age children are able to explain the misleading reasons that have given rise to a false belief. Neuroimaging studies of mentalizing have so far only been carried out in adults. They reveal a system with three components consistently activated during both implicit and explicit mentalizing tasks: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), temporal poles and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). The functions of these components can be elucidated, to some extent, from their role in other tasks used in neuroimaging studies. Thus, the MPFC region is probably the basis of the decoupling mechanism that distinguishes mental state representations from physical state representations; the STS region is probably the basis of the detection of agency, and the temporal poles might be involved in access to social knowledge in the form of scripts. The activation of these components in concert appears to be critical to mentalizing.},

Most constrained wizard production (90.7\%), but few constrained wizard recognition (11\%). Few reported measuring wizard error (3.7\%), and few reported pre-experiment wizard training (5.4\%). Few reported using WoZ in an iterative manner (24.1\%). Based on these results we propose new reporting guidelines to aid future research.},

Reason/Suggestion: Perrin and Spencer participants where mainly engineers and medical student. The problem is that this students are precisely the group of students who consider accuracy of measurement to be very important.

abstract = {Human-Robot Interaction: A Survey presents a unified treatment of HRI-related issues, identifies key themes, and discusses challenge problems that are likely to shape the field in the near future. The authors describe the HRI story from multiple perspectives with an eye toward identifying themes that cross applications. The survey includes research results from a cross section of the universities, government efforts, industry labs, and countries that contribute to HRI, and a cross section of the disciplines that contribute to the field, such as human factors, robotics, cognitive psychology and design. Human-Robot Interaction: A Survey starts out by tracing the early history of robotics and human-machine interaction and the emergence of HRI as a field in its own right. It goes on to discuss what defines an HRI problem and to survey the kinds of problems encountered. The final two sections focus on the accepted practices, challenge problems and solution themes that have emerged as the field has matured. It concludes with a section on how HRI research ties in with work in other scientific fields. Human-Robot Interaction: A Survey is both an ideal tutorial for people outside the field and a timely addition to the current literature within the field which is intended to promote discussion of a unified vision of HRI},

abstract = {The inversion effect describes a phenomenon in which certain types of images are harder to recognize when they are presented upside down compared to when they are shown upright. Images of human faces and bodies suffer from the inversion effect whereas images of objects do not. The effect may be caused by the configural processing of faces and body postures, which is dependent on the perception of spatial relations between different parts of the stimuli. We investigated if the inversion effect applies to images of robots in the hope of using it as a measurement tool for robot's anthropomorphism. The results suggest that robots, similarly to humans, are subject to the inversion effect. Furthermore, there is a significant, but weak linear relationship between the recognition accuracy and perceived anthropomorphism. The small variance explained by the inversion effect renders this test inferior to the questionnaire based Godspeed Anthropomorphism Scale.},

The robot would either be present in the room or only be represented on the participants' computer screen (presence). Furthermore, the participants' partner would either make 20 \% errors or 40 \% errors (error rate). We automatically measured the praising and punishing behavior of the participants towards their partners and also asked the participant to estimate their own behavior. The participants unconsciously praised Aibo more than the human partner, but punished it just as much. Robots that adapt to the users' behavior should therefore pay extra attention to the users' praises, compared to their punishments},

We investigated the effect of this adaptation gap on users' impressions of artificial agents because any variations in impression before and after the start of an interaction determines whether the user feels that this agent is worth interacting with. The results showed that positive or negative signs of the adaptation gap and subjective impression scores of agents before the experiment significantly affected the users' final impressions of the agents.[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

How do we do it? This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?},

@article{Kirby2008,
abstract = {We introduce an experimental paradigm for studying the cumulative cultural evolution of language. In doing so we provide the first experimental validation for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to the appearance of design without a designer. Our experiments involve the iterated learning of artificial languages by human participants. We show that languages transmitted culturally evolve in such a way as to maximize their own transmissibility: over time, the languages in our experiments become easier to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore, this structure emerges purely as a consequence of the transmission of language over generations, without any intentional design on the part of individual language learners. Previous computational and mathematical models suggest that iterated learning provides an explanation for the structure of human language and link particular aspects of linguistic structure with particular constraints acting on language during its transmission. The experimental work presented here shows that the predictions of these models, and models of cultural evolution more generally, can be tested in the laboratory.},

Adults were found to learn a miniature artificial language better when they were initially presented with only small segments of language than when they were presented immediately with the full complexity of the language. Adults who were presented initially with individual words and only later with complex “sentences” composed of several such words learned the meanings and morphology of those words better than did adults who were presented with sentences throughout learning. The externally imposed constraint of processing only small segments of language is conjectured to be similar to the internal processing constraints of children that have been proposed to aid children in their acquisition of language.},
